The multiple reponses to each survey question by the shoppers are recorded as a string seperate by comma (for example, What are your favorite fruits? the answer is recorded as: \"apple, mango, banana, lemon\") To further analyze these responses, I would need to transform those values into multiple-column structure, and then into Boolean datatype. How to do that in Pyspark? And how to process multiple questions at once?
